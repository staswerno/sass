# sass notes

docs: https://sass-lang.com/documentation

"CSS with superpowers"
compiles into plain CSS so browsers can read it.
    possible with Live Sass Compiler VS Code Extension
valid css is also valid sass

there are 2 sass filetypes:
    .scss - easiest/most poppulat
    indented (.sass) - original

to run: click on 'watch sass' at bottom of ide
don't modify the css file!

## variables

sass variables came first
don't compile into css, compile into actual value
100% browser compatibility

## partials

modularise using partials
sass file named with leading underscore
    ignored by compiler

## functions vs mixins

functions should be used to compute/return values
mixins should define styles
mixins good for light/dark themes

## rememeber

- variables
- maps
- partials
- functions
- mixins
- extends
- math operations
